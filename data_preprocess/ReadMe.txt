Python script pipelines:

1. data_process.py
   Match participant via ID (generate file ../data/data_after_process/Match_date_diff_IID.xlsx) --> 

2. process_match.py
   Match the "../data/data_after_process/Match_date_diff_IID.xlsx" with ADNI.mat via the IID and sbjID (generate file "../data/data_after_process/Match2nd_date_diff_trans_IID.xlsx") -->

3. generate_final_data.py
   Filter the data via two conditions:
   1) the tolerance of date difference; 
   2) the tolerance of AD diagnosis error (AD_label & DXGrp)
   Generate the data file named with "date_diff" and "no error" to indicate the different types of our dataset --> 

4. create_newADNI.m
   generate new ADNI data used for the proposed method -->

5. new_data_5fold_pack.m
   generate data (116*3) used for the proposed methods.

6. generate_tensor.py/generate_tensor.m
   generate different tensors (116*116*3 & 116*116) by defining specific neighbor numbers in the KNN graph.

7. add_same_fold.m
   make the cross-validation of data generated by 6-step the same as that by 5-step.
